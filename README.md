## Resources for vegas meetup 2019

This repo has all of the manifests and demo scripts used for this presentation.

The cluster was built using kind.sigs.k8s.io and run entirely from the presenter laptop.

You can run the [setup.sh](./setup.sh) script to populate the images that will be used

Run all of the demo scripts from the root directory of this repo.

The `k8s_root` and `dind` demos do require that the laptop be running some linux distribution and docker.

For both of these examples we are joining the laptop to the kind cluster as a node.
